Computer security is a passion of mine and this blog is a way for me to share my experiences with others. My main interests are vulnerability research, reverse engineering, and exploit development. I work at [BeyondTrust](http://www.beyondtrust.com) as the Vulnerability Research Engineering Team Lead where we constantly research the latest vulnerabilities to hit the scene, while improving the overall design and functionality of the [Retina Network Security Scanner](http://www.beyondtrust.com/Products/RetinaNetworkSecurityScanner/).
